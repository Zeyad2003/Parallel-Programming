# Count-Sort using pthreads

This is a simple implementation of Count-Sort Algorithm using Sequantial approach and Parallel approach using `pthreads`, and show the comparison between time taken by each approach.

> [!NOTE]
> The file contain a function that generate `1e7` random numbers to test the efficiency of the algorithm in both approaches.

## How to run
- Install C++ on your machine
- run the following commands `g++ -o main "Count Sort.cpp"` then `./main`.
